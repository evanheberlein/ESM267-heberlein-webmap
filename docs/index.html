<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">EROSION MODELING IN THE CABY REGION</h1>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">The <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/">Bren School</a> Group Project 
<a href="https://forests2faucets.com/">Forests to Faucets</a> is working with 
<a href="https://www.americanrivers.org/">American Rivers</a> to reduce post-fire erosion 
risk in the central Sierra Nevada mountains of California. This project is focused on the Cosumnes,
American, Bear, and Yuba (CABY) watersheds on the west slope of the Sierras. Forests to Faucets'
main objective is recommending locations for controlled burns to lower fire severity and risk in
sensitive areas of the CABY region, ultimately reducing negative impacts to water quality via post-fire erosion.</p>
<p style="font-family:verdana;">Optimally locating controlled burns requires knowledge of where erosion potential
is high in the CABY region. The <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/ccrc/tools/watershed-erosion-prediction-project">
Watershed Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model</a> is being used to project areas of high erosivity.
The map below demonstrates how WEPP plots watersheds based on a digital elevation model. Zoom in and out
and toggle layers on and off to see the interaction between topography, stream centerlines, and 
subwatersheds (which form units of erosion quantification).</p>
